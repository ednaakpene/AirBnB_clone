## AirBnB Project - The Console

### Project Description:
This is a project that acts like a pretend Airbnb on your computer. Instead of clicking around, you talk to your computer using a special typing language. It's like giving commands to your computer buddy to do things like creating users, managing places, and handling bookings. The goal is to make a simplified Airbnb experience, all through typing and chatting with your computer.

### Command Interpreter
The command interpreter serves as the main interface for interacting with the Airbnb clone. Think of it as a talking system for your computer game. Instead of clicking buttons, you type commands like you're having a chat with your computer friend. You can tell it to make new users, take care of places, book things, and more. It's like a fun conversation with your computer to make your own Airbnb adventure!

### How to start the command line Interpreter
Step 1: Clone the repository to your local machine
Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
Step 3: Run the command interpreter

### How to Use the Command Line Interpreter
Once the command-line interpreter is running, you can enter commands to perform various actions within the Airbnb clone. The general syntax for commands is as follows:
`command_name [optional_argument] [mandatory_argument]`
